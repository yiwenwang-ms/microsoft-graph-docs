# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## October 2022: New and generally available

### Education
- Use application permissions to update the [outcome](/graph/api/resources/educationoutcome) of an [assignment](/graph/api/resources/educationassignment).
- Use application permissions to [submit](/graph/api/educationsubmission-submit), [unsubmit](/graph/api/educationsubmission-unsubmit), [return](/graph/api/educationsubmission-return), or [reassign](/graph/api/educationsubmission-reassign) a [submission](/graph/api/resources/educationsubmission).

### Identity and access | Governance
Manage [access package](/graph/api/resources/accesspackage) or [group](/graph/api/resources/group) resources that are incompatible with one another.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
- Use an [authentication context class reference](/graph/api/resources/authenticationContextClassReference) to specify custom values for a [conditional access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) authentication requirement, to build user-facing custom admin experiences.
- Enable or disable users and groups in an organization to use the [Azure AD native Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA)](/graph/api/resources/x509CertificateAuthenticationMethodConfiguration).

### Reports | Microsoft 365 usage reports
Get reports for [Microsoft 365 app usage](/graph/api/resources/microsoft-365-apps-usage-report), including the usage of Microsoft 365 apps by user, the number of daily unique active users by app, and the number of daily unique active users across all apps by platform (Windows, Mac, web, and mobile).

### Teamwork and communications
- [Send activity feed notifications to multiple users](/graph/api/teamwork-sendActivityNotificationToRecipients), in bulk.
- [Hide](/graph/api/chat-hideforuser) or [unhide](/graph/api/chat-unhideforuser) a [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat) for a user.
- Using delegated permissions to [list chats](/graph/api/chat-list) takes the [viewpoint](/graph/api/resources/chatviewpoint) of the specific user into account. The viewpoint includes whether the user has hidden the chat, and the date/time when the user last read a message in that chat.


## October 2022: New in preview only

### Device and app management | Cloud PCs
Use an [alert rule](/graph/api/resources/devicemanagement-alertrule?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) with prefered notification channels, like email and Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center notification, to monitor and receive alerts when conditions set in alert rules are met. Currently issues with Cloud PCs such as provisioning or checking on-premise network connections can trigger alerts.

### Device and app management | Cloud printing
[Get](/graph/api/print-list-recentshares?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a list of [printer share](/graph/api/resources/printershare?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resources recently used by the signed-in user.

### Identity and access | Governance
Enable a [workflow](/graph/api/resources/identitygovernance-workflow?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or its subsequent versions to run on demand, or on schedule by the Lifecycle Workflows engine based on the schedule defined by tenant settings. 

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in

### Personal contact | Org control for contact insights
Administrators can configure tenant-level privacy control as [organization settings](/graph/api/resources/organizationSettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for displaying or returning contact insights in an organization. An example of contact insights is whether to identify duplicate contacts among a user's contacts list and suggest the user to merge those contacts to have a cleaner contacts list.

### Search | Query
- Specify [options for searching for SharePoint or OneDrive content](/graph/api/resources/sharepointonedriveoptions?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) - the kinds of content to be searched when performing a [search request](/graph/api/resources/searchRequest?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) using application permissions.

### Security | Advanced hunting
[Query](/graph/api/security-security-runhuntingquery?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) event, activity, or entity data in Microsoft 365 Defender to proactively look for specific threats in your environment. This [advanced hunting](/graph/api/resources/security-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true#advanced-hunting-preview) feature enables unconstrained hunting for both known and potential threats.

### Security | Alerts and incidents
Create a [comment](/graph/api/resources/security-alertcomment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for an existing [alert](/graph/api/resources/security-alert?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [incident](/graph/api/resources/security-incident?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

## Want to stay in the loop?

Here are some ways we can engage:

- Are there scenarios you'd like Microsoft Graph to support? Suggest and vote for new features at [Microsoft Feedback Portal](https://aka.ms/graphfeedback).
    Some new features originate as popular requests from the developer community. The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

    1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

    2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`). 
- Be an active member in the Microsoft Graph community! [Join](https://aka.ms/m365-dev-call) the weekly Microsoft 365 platform community call.
- Sign up for the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program), get a free Microsoft 365 subscription, and start developing!
