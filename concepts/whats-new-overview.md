# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.


## January 2022: New and generally available

### Devices and apps | Service health and communications
Get a [service announcement attachment](/graph/api/resources/serviceAnnouncementAttachment) added to a [service update message](/graph/api/resources/serviceupdatemessage).

- Differentiate 3 types of resources whose access is represented through an [access review decision](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem):
  - An [access package assignment policy](/graph/api/resources/accessReviewInstanceDecisionItemAccessPackageAssignmentPolicyResource) for which access is determined by an access review decision.
  - An [Azure resource role](/graph/api/resources/accessReviewInstanceDecisionItemAzureRoleResource) for which access is determined by an access review decision.
  - A [service principal](/graph/api/resources/accessReviewInstanceDecisionItemServicePrincipalResource) whose access to a resource is determined by an access review decision.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
Enforce a [session control](/graph/api/resources/conditionalAccessSessionControls) (by setting the **disableResilienceDefaults** property) to determine whether Azure AD should extend existing sessions based on information collected prior to an outage.

[Create a chat](/graph/api/chat-post) using application permissions.

## January 2022: New in preview only

### Compliance | eDiscovery
Get the URL of a custodian's OneDrive for Business site (**siteWebUrl** property of [userSource](/graph/api/resources/ediscovery-userSource?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true)).

### Devices and apps | Cloud PC
- Get or update [settings for an organization](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcorganizationsettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), which include the Windows operating system version to provision on Cloud PCs, and the user account type on provisioned Cloud PCs.
- [Change the user account type](/graph/api/cloudPC-changeUserAccountType?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) on a specified Cloud PC.

### Identity and access | Governance
- Reviewers of an access review can [record](/graph/api/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem-recordalldecisions?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) decisions for which the current user is the reviewer.
- Configure [the last sign-in date and time of a user as an insight](/graph/api/resources/userLastSignInRecommendationInsightSetting?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to aid reviewers in making decisions for an [access review schedule definition](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewscheduledefinition?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Configure [the last sign-in date and time of a user as an insight](/graph/api/resources/userSignInInsight?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for a [decision on a user or principal's access in an instance of an access review](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewinstancedecisionitem?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- The requestor of an access package can provide custom information as part of an [access package resource](/graph/api/resources/accesspackageresource?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) that may be used to make approval decisions for the access package.

    Some new features originate as popular requests from the developer community. The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

    1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

    2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`).
