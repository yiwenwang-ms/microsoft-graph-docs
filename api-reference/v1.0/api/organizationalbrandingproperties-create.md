# Create organizationalBrandingProperties

Create an [organizationalBrandingProperties](../resources/organizationalbrandingproperties.md) object. This creates the default branding and optionally a localized branding. The default branding is loaded when a localized branding set isn't configured for the user's browser language.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Organization.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

## HTTP request

A branding is created for an organization, if one does not already exist, using PUT or PATCH.

If branding is already configured, PUT overwrites all existing values regardless of what's in the request body. PATCH only overwrites the values that are included in the request body, leaving the values not included unchanged.

The `id` property is ignored on PUT/PATCH to the /branding singleton. If **Content-Language** is not specified, the default branding is created, which corresponds to an `id` of `und`. If **Content-Language** is specified, branding is created for that locale.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PUT /organization/{tenant id}/branding
PATCH /organization/{tenant id}/branding
```

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required.  |
| Content-Language  | Locale. Optional.  |

## Request body

In the request body, include a JSON representation of an [organizationalBrandingProperties](../resources/organizationalbrandingproperties.md) object. The following table lists the required properties.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|backgroundColor|String|Color that appears in place of the background image in low-bandwidth connections. The primary color of your banner logo or your organization color is recommended to be used here. Specify this in hexadecimal (for example, white is #FFFFFF).|
|backgroundImage|Stream|Image that appears as the background of the sign-in page. The image is a .png or .jpg that is not larger than 1920x1080 and smaller than 300kb. A smaller image will reduce bandwidth requirements and make page loads more performant.|
|bannerLogo|Stream|A banner version of your company logo that appears on the sign-in page. The banner is a .png or .jpg no larger than 36x245px. We recommend using a transparent image with no padding around the logo.|
|signInPageText|String|Text that appears at the bottom of the sign-in box. You can use this to communicate additional information, such as the phone number to your help desk or a legal statement. This text must be Unicode and not exceed 1024 characters.|
|squareLogo|Stream|Square version of your company logo. This appears in Windows 10 out-of-box (OOBE) experiences and when Windows Autopilot is enabled for deployment. The logo is a .png or .jpg no larger than 240x240px and no more than 10kb in size. We recommend using a transparent image with no padding around the logo.|
|usernameHintText|String|The hint in the username textbox on the sign-in screen. This text must be Unicode, without links or code, and can't exceed 64 characters.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and the created [organizationalBrandingProperties](../resources/organizationalbrandingproperties.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

The following example creates default branding and localization where **Content-Language** is `en-US`.

### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.organizationalBrandingProperties"
} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Language: en-US

{
    "backgroundColor":"#FFFF33",
    "backgroundImage@odata.mediaContentType":"image/*",
    "backgroundImage@odata.mediaReadLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/backgroundImage",
    "backgroundImage@odata.mediaEditLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/en-US/backgroundImage",
    "bannerLogo@odata.mediaContentType":"image/*",
    "bannerLogo@odata.mediaReadLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/bannerLogo",
    "bannerLogo@odata.mediaEditLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/en-US/bannerLogo",
    "id": "und",
    "signInPageText":"Welcome",
    "squareLogo@odata.mediaContentType":"image/*",
    "squareLogo@odata.mediaReadLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/squareLogo",
    "squareLogo@odata.mediaEditLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization/d69179bf-f4a4-41a9-a9de-249c0f2efb1d/branding/localizations/en-US/squareLogo",
    "usernameHintText":"hint"
}
```

In this case, the default branding object is set. Localized branding for `en-US` is also set due to the **Content-Language** header, even though the `en-US` branding set is not returned in the response. The **Content-Language** header in the request is optional, and if not present, only sets the default branding.
