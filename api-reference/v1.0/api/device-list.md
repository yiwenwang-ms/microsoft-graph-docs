## Request headers

| Name       |  Description|
|:-----------|:------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.device",
  "isCollection": true
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "value": [
    {
      "accountEnabled":true,
      "deviceId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "deviceVersion":1,

      "Manufacturer":"Google",
      "Model":"Pixel 3a",
      "operatingSystemVersion":"10.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Get only a count of devices

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored",
  "name": "get_count_only"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/devices/$count
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/plain

294
```


### Example 3: Use $filter and $top to get one device with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).


# [HTTP](#tab/http)
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_a_count"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/devices?$filter=startswith(displayName, 'a')&$count=true&$top=1&$orderby=displayName 
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
