# Create schema
Namespace: microsoft.graph.externalConnectors



Create a new [schema](../resources/externalconnectors-schema.md) object.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|Not applicable|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not applicable|
|Application| ExternalConnection.ReadWrite.OwnedBy|

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
```http
POST /external/connections/{id}/schema
```
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [schema](../resources/externalconnectors-schema.md) object.

When registering a custom item schema, the `schema` object MUST have the `baseType` property set to `microsoft.graph.externalItem` and MUST contain the `properties` property. The `properties` object must contain at least one property, up to a maximum of 64.

## Response

With the `Prefer: respond-async` header included in the request, if successful, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code and a URL in the `Location` response header that can be used to [get the operation status](../api/externalconnectors-connectionoperation-get.md).

Without the `Prefer: respond-async` header included in the request, if successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [schema](../resources/externalconnectors-schema.md) object in the response body.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating a schema is a long-running process prone to gateway timeouts. We recommend using the `Prefer: respond-async` header to avoid timeout errors.

## Examples

### Example: Register custom schema asynchronously
