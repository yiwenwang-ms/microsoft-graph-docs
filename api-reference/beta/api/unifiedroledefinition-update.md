# Update unifiedRoleDefinition

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of a [unifiedRoleDefinition](../resources/unifiedroledefinition.md) object for an RBAC provider.

The following RBAC providers are currently supported:
- device management (Intune)
- directory (Azure AD) 

> [!NOTE]
> The cloud PC RBAC provider currently supports only the [list](rbacapplication-list-roledefinitions.md) and [get](unifiedroledefinition-get.md) operations.

## Permissions

Depending on the RBAC provider and the permission type (delegated or application) that is needed, choose from the following table the least privileged permission required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in the [Permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference). 

### For Device management (Intune) provider
