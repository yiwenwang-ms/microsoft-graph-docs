# Get organization

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the properties and relationships of the currently authenticated organization.

Since the **organization** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in an **organization** instance.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read, Organization.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Organization.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application | Organization.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Organization.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> **Note**: Applications granted the User.Read permission are able to read only the **id**, **displayName**, and **verifiedDomains** properties of the organization.  All other properties will return with `null` values. To read all properties, use Organization.Read.All.
