# Create a directory setting

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to create a new setting, based on the templates available in directorySettingTemplates. These settings can be at the tenant-level or at an object level (currently only for groups). The creation request must provide settingValues for all the settings defined in the template. For group-specific settings, only the setting governing whether members of a group can invite guest users can be set. This will govern this behavior once the ability to add guest users to a group is generally available.

> **Note**: The /beta version of this API only applies to groups. The /v1.0 version of this API has been renamed to *Create groupSettings*.

For a list of templates and the properties they support in beta, use a [directorySettingTemplate query](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer?request=directorySettingTemplates&version=beta). (For v1.0 endpoints, call [groupSettingTemplates](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer?request=groupSettingTemplates&version=v1.0).)
