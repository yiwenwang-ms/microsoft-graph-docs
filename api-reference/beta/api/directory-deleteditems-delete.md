Permanently delete a recently deleted [application](../resources/application.md), [group](../resources/group.md), [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), or [user](../resources/user.md) object from [deleted items](../resources/directory.md). After an item is permanently deleted, it **cannot** be restored.
