# Create educationSubmissionResource

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add a resource to the submission resource list.

Only the student assigned to the submission can perform this operation.

The operation will not succeed if the **allowStudentsToAddResources** flag is not set to `true`. 

If the caller wants to create a new file-based resource, upload the file to the resources folder associated with the submission. If the file doesn't exist or is not in that folder, the POST request will fail.
