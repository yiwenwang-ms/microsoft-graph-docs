# Azure AD access reviews

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]


You can use [Azure AD access reviews](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-azure-ad-controls-access-reviews-overview) to configure one-time or recurring access reviews for attestation of user's access rights.

Typical customer scenarios for access reviews of group memberships and application and Azure AD role access are:

- Customers can review and certify guest user access to applications, Azure AD roles, and memberships of groups. Reviewers can use the insights that are provided to efficiently decide whether guests should have continued access.

- Customers can review and certify employee access to applications, Azure AD roles, and group memberships with access reviews.

Note that the access reviews feature, including the API, is included in Azure AD Premium P2.  The tenant where an access review is being created must have a valid purchased or trial Azure AD Premium P2 or EMS E5 subscription.

## Role and application permission authorization checks

The following directory roles are required for a calling user to manage access reviews. 

| Operation | Application permissions | Required directory role of the calling user |
|:------------------|:------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Read | AccessReview.Read.All or AccessReview.ReadWrite.All | Global Administrator, Global Reader, Security Administrator, Security Reader or User Administrator |
| Create, Update or Delete | AccessReview.ReadWrite.All | Global Administrator or User Administrator |

In addition, a user who is an assigned reviewer of an access review can manage their decisions, without needing to be in a directory role.
